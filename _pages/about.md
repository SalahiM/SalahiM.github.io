I am a quantitative aquatic ecologist specialized in using data science, simulation and modeling (R & Python). Although I have many years of experience in different subject areas (e.g. ichthyologic knowledge for working in labs, graduated a master's in fishing technology and design, and experience in fisheries stock assessment and dynamics in PhD) but ultimately my research aim is to solve biological problems through data synthesis and mathematical modeling in variety of research projects, including:
+ Trophic studies from single species to holistic modeling of ecosystem food webs
+ Meta-analysis for prediction of threatened species in large scale
+ digital distribution and prediction models for marine ecosystems and climate change scenarios
