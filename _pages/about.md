<<<<<<< HEAD
I am a quantitative aquatic ecologist specialized in using data science, simulation and modeling (R & Python). Although I have many years experience of different subject area (e.g. ichthyologic knowledge for working in labs, graduated as masters in fishing technology and design, and experienced in fisheries stock assessment and dynamic in PhD) but ultimately my research aim to solving biological problems through data synthesis and mathematical modeling in variety of research interests including:
-Trophic studies from single species to holistic modeling of ecosystem food web
-Meta-analysis for prediction threatened species in large scale
-digital distribution and prediction models for marine ecosystems and climate change scenarios
