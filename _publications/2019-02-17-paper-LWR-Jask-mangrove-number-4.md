This study presents length-weight relationships (LWRs) of Liza klunzingeri (Day, 1888), Cociella crocodilus (Cuvier, 1829), Platycephalus indicus (Linnaeus, 1758) belonging to two Families (Mugilidae and Platycephalidae) from northern coastline of Gulf of Oman (Hormozgan province). Samples were collected by artisanal trawl and beach seine (both with 11 mm effective mesh size) monthly during 2010 to 2015. The presented models were highly significant (p < 0.01) with a reliable coefficient of determination (R2 > 0.90) that provides a reliable basic information for ichthyologists and fisheries scientists.
