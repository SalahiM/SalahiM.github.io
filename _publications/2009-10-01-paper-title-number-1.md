Information on the feeding habits of species is essential to develop appropriate conservation actions. This study aimed to assess spatial and temporal variation in the diet of the Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra in the Anzali Wetland, through fecal and stable isotope analysis. Seven main prey items were observed in the analysis of 300 fresh spraints. The highest feeding index was observed for fish, followed by snakes. Among the fish species consumed, the index of preponderance of Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) was the highest followed by pike (Esox lucius) and white bream (Blicca bjoerkna). Results of Shannon diversity index suggest spatial variation of species diversity within and between feeding items (p<0.05); snakes, frogs, and oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) showed a seasonal variation. The otter’s trophic level (TL) (3.79) was higher than the TLs of other Anzali Wetland predators, such as pike. Bayesian mixing model showed source proportion contributions of fish 49.5%, reptiles 16.7%, insects 14.8%, crustacean 10.5%, amphibians 4.3%, birds 4.1%, and mollusks 0.1%. When considering only fish species in the Bayesian mixing model, Prussian carp was the main fish prey in the otters’ diet accounting for 47%. Based on the results of this study, the Eurasian otter plays an important role in the ecology of the Anzali Wetland ecosystem even though it preys on exotic species, such as the Prussian carp and the oriental river prawn.
