In this study, length-length relationships (LLRs) and weight-length relationships (WLRs) were established for a Carangidae species: Uraspis helvola and tow Flatfishes: Pseudorhombus elevatus and Psettodes erumei that are substantial marine fish species to commercial fisheries in Persian Gulf that are indigenous marine fish species in the region. Samples were collected by non-selective fish bottom trawler with stretch mesh size of 4 centimeters at the cod-end area, which helped us to obtain such a broad range size that included small, medium and large size classes during June to August 2017. Hitherto, the length-weight model presented in this study for Pseudorhombus elevatus and Uraspis helvola were not documented on Fishbase. Additionally, new records of maximum length are presented as 64.5 and 30 centimeters for P. erumei and P. elevatus respectively. A comprehensive size distribution and highly significant fitted model (r2>0.95) in this research provides useful insight for future studies on fish biology, fisheries assessment and ecological modeling.
