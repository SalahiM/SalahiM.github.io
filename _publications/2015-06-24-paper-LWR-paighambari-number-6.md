This study presents the first report of length–weight relationships (LWRs) for Uranoscopus guttatus and Lagocephalus inermis from the Iranian coast on the Gulf of Oman. A wide range of body lengths and weights were obtained using samples from non-selective trawling surveys. The LWRs obtained were W = 41.408L3.519 and W = 16.525L2.847 for U. guttatus and L. inermis, respectively.
